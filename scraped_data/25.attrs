The spacious 2 bedrooms and large kitchen make it a perfect place for a young family or an empty nester to call home. It has a HUGE, private, well treed lot that has plenty of room to build a double garage or to develop a lovely garden of any size. It has great neighbours, a fantastic location close to Bowness Park, the river pathway systems, and just around the corner from Bowness High School.  The commute to downtown is on the #1 bus and its an incredible 20 min quick trip. Bowness is a hidden gem with its own grocery stores, restaurants and close knit community.  If you would rather own your own detached house with a yard instead of a Condo(with Condo fees) this house is perfect. For the investor this home can likely be subdivided making it a great holding property with a very nice revenue generator until you are ready to build two infills.
