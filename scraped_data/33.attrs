Totally renovated with great attention to detail in 2002, the current owners have continued to upgrade in the years since then, refinishing the basement (2003), adding a new garage (2004), new landscaping (2003), central air conditioning (2005), and replacing the sewer line to the property line (2007).  The home offers a gracious entry, living room with gas fireplace designed to resemble a wood stove, spacious dining room, chef's kitchen with granite counters, loads of custom cabinetry, upscale appliances and deep farmer's sink.  There are two good-sized bedrooms (one presently used as a den) and a spa-like 4 piece bathroom with soaker tub and separate shower.  Hardwood floors grace the main floor with the exception of the kitchen and bath.
